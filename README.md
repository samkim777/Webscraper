A webscraper for scraping product name, price, rating, and rating sample size. Built with Puppeteer library.
Compatible with both Amazon.ca and Amazon.com.
Items returned will be filtered from descending rating size. That is, items with 10,000 ratings will be shown prior to an item with 9,000 ratings, regardless of their actual rating.
