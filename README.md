###### Items returned will be filtered from highest ratings to lowest ratings. Since > 200 sample size condition will be met by all the items, it seems fitting that higher ratings hold more value. 

###### Reviews are mostly J-shaped, meaning consumers either *hate* or *love* the product. This means that if an item is a happy purchase for many, chances are you'll like it too.
