#  What statistical inference could a buyer conclude from an item's rating and the number of ratings that it has received?

## - Factors:

     ### - **Selection Bias**: Who are more likely to leave a review for their purchase?
        #### - ** Consumer with radical opinion on the product.** Customer reviews are often highly polarized, and therefore a bimodal distribution of reviews, or a J-shaped distribution. They either love it or hate it.
        #### - **Fake reviews.** The company distributing the product may use fake reviews to exploit the fact that 93% of total consumers rely on online reviews for their purchase decision, and positive review can boost sales by up to 31%. On the contrary, a negative review can hurt sales by potentially upto 59%.
        #### - ** Consumers asked by the product's company**. Around 68% of customers are willing to write reviews for the company when asked.

    ### - ** Price Sensitivity**: The higher the price of an item is, the more sensitive its star rating to change.

    ### - ** Time frame variability **: If an item has changed price due to an external factor - such as seasonal demand of air conditioners rising during summer - then this affects the review of the item. It could be subject to harsher reviews when its price is higher, and vice-versa, more lenient reviews when the price is deducted. So the history of prices is an important factor.
